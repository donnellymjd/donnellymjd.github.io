Current Model-Estimated Exposure Probability Per 10 Contacts
: This chart shows the current average probability in each state of coming into contact with a currently infectious person for every 10 contacts. It is important to note that transmission of COVID-19 from a contagious person to a suceptible (uninfected) person does not occur at every contact. As a result, the average risk of catching COVID-19 per 10 contacts is lower than this chart would suggest. However, there is a wide degree of variation in the concentrations of active infections even within a state. So, even if a state shows a low number in this chart, risk of transmission in any particular instance may be substantially higher. Please continue to follow public health officials' guidance to maintain physical distance, wear masks, and wash your hands frequently.
